<p>This game was developed in pure C++ by a team of four Computer Game Programming students over three months. I was responsible for standardizing the asset creation and loading pipeline and producing all 3D assets. I also designed the gameplay map using our bitmap level-loading pipeline. I led high-level design discussions and maintained up-to-date documentation and task lists.</p>
