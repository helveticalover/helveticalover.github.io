<p>This animation was developed in Maya over three months with a team of five Animation, Art and Technology students. I was the team lead, providing both creative and technical direction, as well as organizing team meetings and discussions. I pitched the storyboard and animatic to move this animation forward as a final project. I also modeled and rigged the body of both characters and animated body movements for half of the shots. In addition, I contributed to simulation work, rendering and post-processing in Premiere.</p>
