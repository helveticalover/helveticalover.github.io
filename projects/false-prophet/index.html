<p>This 114-page campaign book was written for Gerard Klug's class RPG Writing Workshop by a team of four writers. I wrote all materials for Act 4, which consists of a story beats section, a gameplay section, and a dramatic sceenplay. I also created supporting materials such as NPC character sheets, maps, and artwork. I was responsible for laying out and printing the book.</p>
